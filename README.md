Description
=======
Since PingList doesn't seems to be maintained anymore, I've decided to implement my own version, much thanks for @Dutch1ee for the idea and @Ozelo for pushing me into making this.

Features
=======
* Shows latency on the tablist
* Support for colored names

Future Features
=======
* Autokick based on measured latency
* Configurable and colored measures
