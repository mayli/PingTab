Description
=======
Since PingList doesn't seems to be maintained anymore, I've decided to implement my own version, much thanks for @Dutch1ee for the idea and @Ozelo for pushing me into making this.

Configuration
=======
On config.yml you can set the measure interval in seconds

Features
=======
* Shows latency on the tablist
* Support for colored names

Planned Features
=======
* Autokick based on measured latency
* Configurable and colored measures
* ICMP latency measurements
* /ping [player|self] command
* Permissions for /ping command
* List players on tab based on radius and or limits for big servers
* List players order by own faction, enemy factions, other factions and lonewolves
