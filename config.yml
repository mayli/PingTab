# SamplingAmount : Defines the amount of samples used to calculate the average,
#                  notice that this setting can be tricky, since it can
#                  significantly increase memory consuption depending on the
#                  number of players and the amount of samples. Ie:
#                  - Default:
#                    100 players * 20 samples * 4 bytes = 8000 bytes or around
#                    8 KBytes.
#                  - Changed:
#                    100 players * 100 samples * 4 bytes = 40000 bytes or around
#                    40 Kbytes 
SamplingAmount: 20


# TabMode: Defines the mode of measurements shown in the scoreboard and
#          /ping list command.
#          They can be:

#            Average - Use the mean average of the last <SamplingAmount> values.
#            Median - Use the median of the last <SamplingAmount> values. (Default)
#            Mode - Use the mode of the last <SamplingAmount> values.
#                   If there's no repeated measurement, use the Median as
#                   result.
#            Midrange - Use the midrange of the last <SamplingAmount> values.
#            MixedAverage - Use the mean average of the calculated Average,
#                           Median, Mode and Midrange values.
